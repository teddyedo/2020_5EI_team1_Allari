| **Team**                | [Allari Edoardo](https://github.com/teddyedo) - [Bologna Abreham](https://github.com/AbrehamBologna) - [Nicolis Pietro](https://github.com/pietronicolis1) - [Pollinari Jonhatan](https://github.com/JhonnyPol) - [Zerbato Nicol√≤](https://github.com/NicoZerba)     |
| **Financial information**        | Since it is a school project, it does not require any financial outlay                                                                     |
| **Project priorities**        | The application must be delivered by the deadline of the project and it must be able to communicate with other clients within the network     |
| **Approach**            | Scrum framework during TPI and GPI lessons; individual work at home| 
| **Constraints**         | No specific constraints have been imposed for the realization of the project|
| **Success criteria**          | The application must be able to communicate with other clients connected on the network|
| **Risks**          | One risk the team can face is the lack of time to complete the project. Another risk may be the lack of knowledge for the development of some software components|
|**Scope**           | The main purpose of the project is the creation of an application level protocol from scratch, based on TCP and to be used for the creation of a local communication system (chat) managed by a central server developed by a single group; communication must be made through client applications developed by the remaining groups.|
