# Overview

## Purpose and scope

Our team is responsible for creating one of the six client applications that are part of the project started by Professor Antonio Sette.

The project consists of the creation of an application-level "chat" communication protocol and its implementation.

The creation of the protocol takes place through the contribution of all the teams, while the subsequent development is to the detriment of each individual team.

The precise purpose of our team is to create a client application that supports the PCP protocol designed and that is able to communicate, through text messages, with the other clients connected to the main server.

In addition, the creation of a graphical interface is required to provide a better user experience.

## Goals and objectives

- Create a working application, able to communicate with the main server;
- Implement a graphical interface for the application which must be:
  - Responsive;
  - User-friendly;
  - aesthetically attractive;
- Structuring the project according to the MVC framework;
- Use new work tools like Github or graphics framework like Swing / SWT.

## Project deliverables

|  Product                       | Date       |
| :----------------------------- | :--------- |
| ChatSiGira v. 1.0              | 12/12/2019 |

The first version of the project includes all the functions required for delivery, with the exception of managing messages longer than a package (2048 bytes). It is also equipped with a graphic interface.

## Constraints

Being a school project, we must not respect particular constraints, if not that of having to use GitHub for co-working and Java as a programming language. However, the fundamental constraint is the delivery date.

# Schedule and budget summary

## Cost estimate

For the same reason as the constraints, no financial outlay is necessary for the realization of the project. However, approximately 120-150 hours of work will have to be invested

|       Minor bug fixes and closure of the project   | 12/12/2019 |
|       Publish documentation   | 05/01/2019 |

## Success criteria

To be considered a success, the delivered product must be able to interface with the main server and the other clients within the LAN, through the use of a graphic interface.

| WhatsApp group     | Exchange of any type of request, information, doubt, proposal relating to the project. | All team members | Instant messaging | As needed |
| GitHub Issues     | Opening of an issue on GitHub to draw the group's attention to a particular aspect of the project.| All team members | GitHub function | As needed |

## Technical process

The development of this project is based on SCRUM methodology: at the beginning of each lesson the situation is taken and the tasks to be completed on that day are decided. The first iteration consists in the creation of a client application running 100% without a graphical interface; subsequent iterations will focus on implementing a graphical interface and additional features.

## Tools

These are the tools that will be used in this project:

- Programming languages:
  - Java;
- Markup languages:
  - Markdown;
- Java Swing as GUI framework;
- Git and GitHub;
- Visual Studio Code;
- Eclipse (IDE);
- NetBeans (IDE).
