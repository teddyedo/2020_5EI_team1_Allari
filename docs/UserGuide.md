# 1  Introduction

ChatSiGira is a client application that allows, thanks to the presence of a centralized server, communication with other clients connected to the same server. The application will provide login via a graphical interface by choosing your username and then it will connect to the global room to start talking with the other connected users. Users will be free to choose whether to write a message in the global chat or start a private conversation with a single user.

This document provides instructions for using the application to chat with other users connected to the same server.
