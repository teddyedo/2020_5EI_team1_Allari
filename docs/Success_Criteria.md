# <span style="color:red">**Success criteria for the Chat project**</span>
## <span style="color:blue">**The Chat project will be considered a success if. . .**</span> 
 - A fully functional test system is delivered by December 13th.
 - The system must be delivered in a ready state for use in the intended production environment for the intended purpose.
 - Users must receive the training they need to start using the system.

Both of these goals will be considered and if users have questions during the system development period, they must be resolved before December 5th.

## <span style="color:blue">**Changes and questions**</span>

Questions raised during the development and trial period are addressed based on the troubleshooting plan contained in the software project management plan.

All **critical defects** found **before November 5th will be resolved**. A critical flaw is a flaw for which there is no convenient solution. In addition to correcting defects, the requested changes will be managed on an escalator. <span style="color:red">Changes that require 30 hours or less will be made if notified at least 3 weeks before the planned end of the project</span>. Changes that require 20 hours or less will be made if notified at least 2 weeks before the planned end of the project. Changes that require 10 hours or less will be made if notified at least 1 week before the planned end of the project.

Users must be informed about the features and possibilities of the Chat in order to make correct use of it.

## <span style="color:blue">**Login**</span>

	A user can easily log into the system.

This specifically means that the user will be able to select the access option, type their first and last name or part of their first and / or last name, select a room of interest and press a confirmation button.

## <span style="color:blue">**Supervisor**</span>

    Chat supervisors can edit rooms by adding new ones or deleting old ones.

In particular, a ***supervisor will be able to access the system***, select the rooms option and add or remove them. In addition, this means that supervisors will be able to control the rooms available for access to a specific group of users.

> However . . .

Chat ***supervisors cannot create and edit other users' accounts.***
This means that the accounts of students, directors and colleagues can only be banned or restricted but cannot be directly modified by supervisors.

## <span style="color:blue">**Sever**</span>
The Chat Server is constantly updated.
Data from the existing Chat database is loaded into the new system. The data of all fields in the existing database must be migrated to the corresponding fields every tyme a client is connected.


Server Chat supervisors can print all reports described in communications between various users.

## <span style="color:blue">**Source**</span>

   

> The data relating to the Server Chat, appointment and method of use are available for [download](https://github.com/JacopoWolf/PotatoChatProtocol/blob/master/docs/PCP-Min.md) on Git Hub.

New **users must be able to download both the Server Chat and the documentation** in order to encode the tests and at the end of these carry out the necessary documentation.

> **The project is adequately documented**

+ **First**
    + <span style="color:green">a user</span> [**manual**](https://github.com/JacopoWolf/PotatoChatProtocol/blob/master/docs/PCP-Min.md) <span style="color:green">with the system</span><span style="color:red"> must </span><span style="color:green">be produced and included</span>. This user **manual should be easy to understan**d for non-technical users who are familiar with the basic concepts of the Internet. This manual only explains how to use all the features of the system.

+ **Second**
	+ <span style="color:green">a system</span> [**manual**](https://github.com/JacopoWolf/PotatoChatProtocol/blob/master/docs/PCP-Min.md) <span style="color:red"> must </span><span style="color:green">be produced</span>. This system **manual must contain the architecture document**, as well as any additional material necessary to provide a technician with all the information necessary to maintain and update the system. A single reading of this document and no more than 2 hours looking at the code should provide a suitably qualified technician with all the information necessary to understand the system and make simple changes such as adding a field to a generated report.

Some Markdown text with <span style="color:red">Changes that require 30 hours or less will be made if notified at least 3 weeks before the planned end of the project</span>.

Known **defects are communicated** through specific platforms (eg **GIT HUB**).

**At the end** of the project there must be **no unsolved defects** that inhibit the correct functioning of the system.
