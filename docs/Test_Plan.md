# Test Plan

For ChatSiGira, version 1.0 approved <br>


## Introduction 
This document outlines the test plan for the ChatSiGira client.  Incidents, Defects and Changes that need to be made will be presented here formally.  Although the ideas expressed here are separate entities, they will be combined into this one document.

## Items and features test
The test routine will test the exchange of messages between one client and another. It will also test user log in and log out. The results of this test procedure will allow the creators of this system to evaluate the success of the project.
## Approach
The tests were carried out manually. For each iteration, both old and newly implemented features are tested.
## Item Pass /Fail Criteria
To be considered a success, the delivered product must be able to interface with the main server and the other clients within the LAN, through the use of a graphic interface. By carrying out the various tests, we have ascertained that the goal has been achieved.



# Test Deliverables
In addition to the Test Plan, other test deliverables include the Test Case Specification which outlines the specific test cases and expected results of each test, and Test reports which is comprised of Incidents, Defects and Changes. The test case specifications for this project are available on a [specific document](https://github.com/teddyedo/2020_5EI_team1_Allari/blob/master/docs/Test%20Case%20Specification.md).
